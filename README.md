# Simple app to track your habits

Based on the excellent [Loop Habit Tracker](https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits/). I wanted to have this app available so I could test the
waters of iOS.

It can import the database of Loop and uses the same schema.

## Features

- supports only yes/no habits for now
- can schedule notifications
- score graph
- calendar view
- month bar chart
- import loop database export
- export database as sqlite file

## Not yet implemented

- numerical habits
- streaks
- frequency map
- localizations
- probably much more
